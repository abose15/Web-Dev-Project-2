# TOURS AND TRAVELS WEBSITE
This is a front-end web development project that gives an insight on how to develop a clone website of an existing website. Here in this project a clone of Netflix is built using HTML and CSS. 
## Short explanation of the code
This project is a frontend-only website for a tours and travel company, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features a user-friendly design with responsive layouts, interactive elements, and engaging visual content to enhance the user experience.

**Features:**

Feel free to explore the code and suggest improvements.
